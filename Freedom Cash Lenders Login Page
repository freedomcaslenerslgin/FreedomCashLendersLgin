A payday loan is an ultra-short-term loan with a very high interest rate and often requires repayment in full within 15 to 30 days. Because these loan terms are so short, the loan amounts are often limited to $500 or less.

While these loans often conveniently skip the credit check process as long as you show proof of sufficient income, they’re very expensive and leave borrowers holding a substantial amount of risk.

That’s why we often recommend our readers consider applying for personal loans through an online lending network. While these loans will consider your credit history and credit score in the qualification process, they have very forgiving approval standards and often approve those who can’t get loans through a bank.

Personal loans have a more affordable interest rate and offer larger loan amounts. Since these are installment loans, you can enjoy the ability to pay your lender back over time through a fixed monthly payment.
